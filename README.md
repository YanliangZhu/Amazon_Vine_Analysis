# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
M16
## Overview

This project is to explore Amazon customer review of the products. For this project, I examined the reviews posted to the pet product category. First, I uploaded the data into SQL form, then analyzed the reviews based of people who give 5 starts based on their vine status.

## Result

I found that 99% of customers who give 5 stars are vine N status. This result can be viewed as a bias in Vine Y customers (who, by logic, consistent of 1% of total customers who give 5 starts)

## Summary

I found that there might be a bias in Vine Y customers that results in them giving less 5 start review.
